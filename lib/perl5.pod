=head1 NAME

perl5 - Use a Bunch of Modules in One Go

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use perl5;
    use perl5-i;
    use perl5-2i;
    use perl5-ingy;
    use perl5-yourShinyPlugin;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<perl5> module lets you C<use> a well known set of modules in one
command.

It allows people to create plugins like C<perl5::foo> and C<perl5::bar> that
are sets of useful modules that have been tested together and are known to
create joy.

=head1 USAGE

This:

    use perl5-foo;

Is equivalent in Perl to:

    use perl5 '-foo';

The C<perl5> module takes the first argument in the C<use> command, and uses
it to find a plugin, like C<perl5::foo> in this case.

C<perl5::foo> is typically just a subclass of L<perl5::base>. It invoke a set
of modules for its caller.

If you use C<perl5> with no arguments, like this:

    use perl5;

It is the same as saying:

    use perl5-base

In other words, it just assumes the perl5 plugin base class. This is actually
useful. It is equivalent to:

    use 5.010;
    use strict;
    use warnings;

=head1 INSPIRATION

This module was inspired by Michael Schwern's L<perl5i>, and the talk he gave
about it at the 2010 OSDC in Melbourne. By "inspired" I mean that I was
perturbed by Schwern's non-TMTOWTDI attitude towards choosing a standard set
of Perl modules for all of us.

    THIS IS PERL! THERE ARE NO STANDARDS!

...and I told him so. I also promised that I would show him my feelings in
code. Schwern, I<this> is how I feel!

For extra credit, I will release perl5::i, that will attempt to be equivalent
to perl5i::latest (except better at golf).

DISCLAIMER: Mr Schwern has my full love and respect, and knows it well. :)
