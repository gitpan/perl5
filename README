NAME
    perl5 - Use a Bunch of Modules in One Go

SYNOPSIS
        use perl5;
        use perl5-i;
        use perl5-2i;
        use perl5-ingy;
        use perl5-yourShinyPlugin;

DESCRIPTION
    The "perl5" module lets you "use" a well known set of modules in one
    command.

    It allows people to create plugins like "perl5::foo" and "perl5::bar"
    that are sets of useful modules that have been tested together and are
    known to create joy.

    This module, "perl5", is generally the base class to such a plugin.

USAGE
    This:

        use perl5-foo;

    Is equivalent in Perl to:

        use perl5 '-foo';

    The "perl5" module takes the first argument in the "use" command, and
    uses it to find a plugin, like "perl5::foo" in this case.

    "perl5::foo" is typically just a subclass of perl5. It invoke a set of
    modules for its caller.

    If you use "perl5" with no arguments, like this:

        use perl5;

    It is the same as saying:

        use 5.010;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

API
    To create a plugin called "perl5::foo" that gets called like this:

        use perl5-foo;

    Write some code like this:

        package perl5::foo;
        use perl5;
        our $VERSION = 0.12;
        our @ISA = qw[perl5];

        # These is the code that will be run when people use your module:
        sub code {
            return <<"...";
        use SomeModule 0.22;
        use OtherModule 0.33 option1 => 2;
        ...
        }

        1;

INSPIRATION
    This module was inspired by Michael Schwern's perl5i, and the talk he
    gave about it at the 2010 OSDC in Melbourne. By "inspired" I mean that I
    was perturbed by Schwern's non-TMTOWTDI attitude towards choosing a
    standard set of Perl modules for all of us.

        THIS IS PERL! THERE ARE NO STANDARDS!

    ...and I told him so. I also promised that I would show him my feelings
    in code. Schwern, *this* is how I feel!

    For extra credit, I will release perl5::i, that will attempt to be
    equivalent to perl5i::latest (except better at golf).

    DISCLAIMER: Mr Schwern has my full love and respect, and knows it well.
    :)
